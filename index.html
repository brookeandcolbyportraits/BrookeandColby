        <h2>Welcome Brooke & Colby Portaits</h2>
        <p>As I gaze at pictures of my family or flip through old photo albums, I am overcome with a feeling that is difficult to put into words. It is a feeling of happiness, delight, and joy that is difficult to describe. That is the feeling I strive to capture in the photos I take for the families I have the privilege of working with. Whether it's the candid laughter, the gentle touches, or the unforgettable emotions, I aim to capture it all and provide families with beautiful memories they can look back on with joy..</p>

        <h2>Investment</h2>
        <p>Capturing beautiful and fleeting moments is an investment in one another. I pour my heart into every session and adventure I am a part of, and believe that these moments are truly priceless. Whether it's dancing barefoot in your backyard, making mud pies with the kids, or holding each other while the wind whispers across your faces on the side of a mountain, I am fully committed to creating and documenting these special memories with you. I understand that choosing the right photographer is a big decision, and I encourage you to consider how you feel when you look at my work. If you feel a connection, I would be honored to capture these meaningful moments with you.

In addition to offering a range of services for couples, families, and mothers, I have a particular passion for documenting all seasons of motherhood. As a mother myself, I understand the profound joy and exhaustion that comes with this role, and I believe that these moments deserve to be remembered and celebrated. My family and newborn lifestyle sessions aim to capture the candid laughter, simple touches, and memorable emotions that make your family unique.

I am also drawn to the intimacy and emotion of smaller, intimate ceremonies and elopements. Whether it's in your backyard with your closest friends and family, or on the sandy beaches of Mexico, or in the snowy mountains, I want you to know and feel my entire heart on your special day. I am fully invested in preserving the intimate, beautiful feeling of your adventure, and I promise to give you my all.".</p>
